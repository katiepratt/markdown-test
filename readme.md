Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

And if i keep typing, what happens to the footnote. 

Looks like it just goes down

[^1]: This is the footnote.

but what if i type here? Doesn't matter - footnote is at the bottom of the page.

term
: definition

That is so funny! :joy:

I need to highlight these ==very important words== < ok this doesn't work in GitHub

H~2~O

OK so strikethrough uses ~ ~strikethrough~
